# ev3motor_copy - bash version

After discovering Touch Sensor and the both Large Motors, the position and speed of the Large Motor plugged in 'outA' port are
is copyed in the Large Motor plugged in 'outB'.

The Touch Sensor is used to reset the both Large Motors at any time.

To exit this great program, just press CTRL-C (this should be change later - See TODO).

Keep in mind it's just an ev3dev discovering trainning. It's too slow, and sometimes, destination Large Motor takes some
unexpected movings.


Using soft and libs :

* ev3dev : the Debian based ev3 Brick OS : [http://www.ev3dev.org/](http://www.ev3dev.org/)

Help and advices from :

* All of [http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/)
* The bash man page (everybody forgot this best friend of shell coders.)

Many thanks to them all.
